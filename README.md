# EnvMon Project 🌱🌡️

A simple Environment Monitoring project built with Python.  
It simulates temperature and humidity readings, logs them into a CSV file, and prints live readings to the console.  
You can later extend it to connect with real sensors (like DHT11, DHT22, or IoT devices).

## Features
✅ Simulates temperature (20°C – 35°C) and humidity (30% – 70%)  
✅ Logs data with timestamps into `environment_log.csv`  
✅ Prints real-time readings every 5 seconds  
✅ Easy to extend for real hardware sensors
